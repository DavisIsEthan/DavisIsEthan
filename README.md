Hi there, my name is Ethan Davis, usually just Davis. This space is currently under construction (and more than likely will be forever, as progress is constant).
Here you can find coding projects I completed through my college education, mainly scientific computing, but including:
- Data Collection, Processing, and Visualization
- Machine Learning for Data Analysis
- Miscellaneous Projects as I learn new packages/languages

Projects are categorized by their topic (e.g. from the above list). The overwhelming majority of projects are done in Python, but some C-family, Perl, and even Gnuplot make appearances.
